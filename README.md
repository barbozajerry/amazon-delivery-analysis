## Abstract

After recieving my bachelor's in **Applied Mathemathisc** from **University of California Davis**, I began working at **Amazon** in **December 2021** while pursuing my second bachelor's degree in **Computer Science**. On **May 12, 2025** I then completed my **Master's degree in Computer Science** from **Arizona State Univeristy**. As in July 13, 2025, I am still working at Amazon as an **Associate L1**, bringing **smiles to customers** by helping their packages arrive on time and in perfect condition.

Now that Iâ€™ve completed my Masterâ€™s degree, I am actively applying for **Data Analytics** roles within **Amazon** where I can apply my skills in **Python, SQL, Data Visualization,** and **Statistics**. Iâ€™m passionate about using these tools to help others and excited to continue **supporting Amazonâ€™s mission to bring smiles to customers through data-driven insights**.
